5) HOW CAN YOU PICK A RANDOM ITEM FROM LIST OR TUPLE ?
	create a tuple and add some dummy data to it
~~~> generate a random item from the tuple using random.choice()method.
   (this function returns a random element from the specefied sequence .)

6) HOW CAN YOU PICK  A RANDOM ITEM FROM RANGE?
 --> using random.randrange() function
---> using random.randint() function
---> using random.random() function.

7) HOW WILL YOU SET THE STARTING VALUE IN GENERATING RANDOM NUMBERS?
	the seed() method is used to intialize the random number generator
  for example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
import random 
random.seed(10)
print(random.random())


8) HOW WILL YOU RANDOMIZES THE ITEMS OF A LIST IN PLACE?

     (for ex):
	import random
	list=[20,16,10,5]

	print(list)


9) why are you use zip method?
